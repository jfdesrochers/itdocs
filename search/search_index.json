You can use the default location (just press \nenter\n) or specify your own.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nMake sure you don't overwrite any existing file, because you may break an existing connection if you do.\n\n\n\n\nYou will then be prompted to enter a passphrase. This step is optional, but recommended, especially if you share your machine with other people. If you specify a passphrase, you will be prompted for it every time you use the key to login using SSH.\n\n\nYou should then have two files at your specified location: \nid_rsa\n, which is your \nprivate\n key (do NOT share with anyone) and \nid_rsa.pub\n, which is your \npublic\n key (that you will put on your server).\n\n\n2 - Copying your key to the server\n\n\nNow you need to copy your new key to your server. You will need either a password-based SSH account or physical access to the machine for this step. Here are two ways of doing this:\n\n\nUsing \nssh-copy-id\n\n\nIf you have \nssh-copy-id\n available on your system this step is easy, just run the following command:\n\n\nssh-copy-id yourusername@yourserver\n\n\n\n\n\nyourusername\n should be a password-based SSH account on your server.\n\n\nCopying the key manually\n\n\nYou will need to copy the \nid_rsa.pub\n you have generated earlier to your server and add the contents to \n~/.ssh/authorized_keys\n.\n\n\nFirst, you need to check if the .ssh directory exists in your home directory. You can create it using the following command:\n\n\nmkdir -p ~/.ssh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nThe \nmkdir -p\n command is perfectly harmless if the directory already exists.\n\n\n\n\nThen, you need to copy the contents of the id_rsa.pub file into a file called \nauthorized_keys\n:\n\n\ncat id_rsa.pub \n ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, you need to make sure the permissions are right for these files:\n\n\nchmod -R \ngo\n=\n ~/.ssh\nchown -R yourusername:yourusername ~/.ssh\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first command removes the permissions for anyone other than \nyourusername\n and the second command ensures that \nyourusername\n is the owner the the \n.ssh\n directory and all its contents. Make sure to substitute \nyourusername\n with the name of the actual account on your server.\n\n\n3 - Testing the password-less authentication\n\n\nNow that everything is set-up, try to log on to your server using SSH:\n\n\nssh yourusername@yourserver\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your server still asks for a password (other than the private key passphrase, if using) or if it refuses the connection, please verify that you have followed all the steps above.\n\n\n4 - Disabling password-based authentication\n\n\nOnce you have tested that you can log on using your key, you can increase your server security by disabling password-based authentication.\n\n\n\n\nDanger\n\n\nMake sure that your key is working and that it is safely stored. Disabling password-based authentication will effectively lock you out of your server should you lose that key! Always make sure that you have a contingency plan!\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have tested and are able to login using only the key, you will have to edit the SSHd configuration to disable password authentication. On most linux servers, this will allow you to edit the config file:\n\n\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\n\n\n\n\nIf that file, find and uncomment (remove the \n#\n) the line that says:\n\n\n#PasswordAuthentication yes\n\n\n\n\n\nand change it to:\n\n\nPasswordAuthentication no\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nWhile you are in that configuration file, you should change the default port for SSH. Look for the \nPort 22\n directive and change it to a port \n 1024 for increased security. Make sure that the chosen port is not occupied by another service and that it is enabled in your firewall.\n\n\n\n\nSave the file and restart your server to enable the changes.\n\n\n5 - Creating an alias to accelerate the connection\n\n\nNow that you can login using a key, why stop there? If you have change the port on your server, the command would now be something like:\n\n\nssh -p \n2022\n yourusername@yourserver.com\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if I told you that it could only be:\n\n\nssh yourserver\n\n\n\n\n\nNeat, no?
